# LSTM-time-series

## A LSTM which is used to predict the Battery power consumption at Saarland University Germany. 

This project was built to predict the battery power consumption at saarland university. The key features are described below:
* Provides a way to visualise the data.
* Makes a prediction on the battery consumption using a number of values from the previous timeframe which can be adjusted by the window length.


The input data was the battery consumption in csv format which was changed to a proper time series data. While trying this for your own applications use a good input time data in a csv format.
